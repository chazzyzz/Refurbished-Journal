|Meetings|Content|
| --- | --- |
| 26.5.23  | Getting things started |
| 23.6.23 | Second meeting about finding a more concise topic, written concept was very vague and didn't have much to say, is it going to be a product? is it not going to be a product? |
| 27.10.23    | Third meeting, getting back on track, the technical knowledge is helpful but isn't required in such depth.  |
| 2.11.23    | Fourth meeting, discussed the revised concept, more clear now, shorten the technical theory parts , opting for an approach to create lesson materials or opting for a guide on using AI as a writing tool for papers. |
| 29.11.23    | Short meeting, due to restrictions in the subject I have to write about the utilization of AI in the context of english classes, finalize what is needed to write the thesis: work with class materials + supporting frame  |

## 26.5.23

- conducting general research work on the web whenever the term AI appears
- found very few research experiments conducted for existing implementation of AI

## 23.6.23 - 27.10.23

- trying to specify further what thesis should not just generally cover AI -> too broad
- getting inspiration from reading books on AI "Generative Deep Learning Teaching Machines to Paint, Write, Compose, and Play" by David Foster acts as a very good foundation for understanding AI technology and some real world implementations
- I skimmed over "Deep Learning from Scratch: Building with Python from First Principles." by Seth Weidmann and found some useful nuggets of information on deep learning specifically
- "In Search of the Human Mind" by Robert Sternberg doesn't add all that much relevant information towards this project but covers some interesting philosophical aspects
- Looking across several universities it was evident that they were trying to act fast, although there are no actual policies as of writing

## 27.10.23-29.11.23

- Mainly figuring out what my paper is exactly about 

## 1.12.23-8.1.24

- Initial start of writing phase, spent a lot of time thinking about what sections to include in theory while still keeping it at an intellectually simple standpoint
- tried contacting Sarah Aloatti for an interview
- towards winter break is when I realized that there's still a lack of understanding what goes into effective curriculum design
- read up on a lot oh dlh.zh.ch, provided a lot of insight in how swiss education plans on dealing with AI
- tried contacting Sarah Aloatti again and several other faculty members at UZH
- Writing and rewriting a lot of sections until finish
- Handed in the physical print of the thesis on the 8.1.24
